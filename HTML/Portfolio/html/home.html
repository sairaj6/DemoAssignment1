                A wiki (/ˈwɪki/ (listen) WIK-ee) is an online hypertext publication 
                collaboratively edited and managed by its own audience, using a web 
                browser. A typical wiki contains multiple pages for the subjects or 
                scope of the project, and could be either open to the public or limited
                to use within an organization for maintaining its internal knowledge base.
                Wikis are enabled by wiki software, otherwise known as wiki engines. A wiki 
                engine, being a form of a content management system, differs from other web-based 
                systems such as blog software, in that the content is created without any defined 
                owner or leader, and wikis have little inherent structure, allowing structure to 
                emerge according to the needs of the users.[1] Wiki engines usually allow content 
                to be written using a simplified markup language and sometimes edited with the help 
                of a rich-text editor.[2] There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, both 
                standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems. Some wiki engines 
                are open-source, whereas others are proprietary. Some permit control over different functions 
                (levels of access); for example, editing rights may permit changing, adding, or removing material.
                 Others may permit access without enforcing access control. Other rules may be imposed to organize content.
